<h3>data_analytics</h3>
This repository contains practice code for data visualization using Python. It is part of a daily exercise routine aimed at gaining expertise in data analytics. The code will be updated regularly on GitHub as new practices are completed.

Contents
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with Python code for various data visualization techniques.

datasets/: Sample datasets used for data visualization practice.

visualizations/: Output visualizations generated from the code.

Usage
To run the Jupyter notebooks and practice data visualization, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using pip or conda as specified in the requirements.txt file.

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
or

bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start Jupyter and open the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.
